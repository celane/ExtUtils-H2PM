Revision history for ExtUtils-H2PM

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Avoid warning about comparing unsigned int < 0
         * Removed evil action-at-a-distance END{} block; now users must call
           write_output()
         * Try to use Module::Build's configuration if present - useful for
           include_dirs, extra_compiler_flags, extra_linker_flags

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Allow structures to have a data tail; extra bytes at the end
         * Allow renaming of generated constant functions
        
        BUGFIXES:
         * Cast struct member pointers to char* so ptrdiff_t actually makes
           sense
         * Use the correct printf format specifiers for ptrdiff_t and size_t

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
